# Randomizer

Here's a list of what I think I'll want/have to learn, and how much I think I've mastered that aspect.

1. How lev.ark is structured. [60%]
2. How a save's lev.ark differs from the original lev.ark, if it does. [0%]
3. How to create and manipulate JSON in C#. I think it'd be cool to export and import a lev.ark, so people can use whatever tool they want to modify a game, even by hand. [0%]
4. How to better convert binary to JSON, and vice-versa. [0%]
5. What every item property/flag does, or at least the most important ones. [25%]
  - This is related to how enchantments work, like, what's the difference between a ring of levitate/jump and unsurpassed protection.
6. Figure out what I could potentially move without breaking stuff. [0%]
7. Figure out how containers work, and enemy inventories. [0%]
8. If I'm ever to randomize UW2, I'll have to figure out how to recompress the lev.ark, so the original can read it. [0%]
9. How to create spoiler logs of changes. [0%]
10. How to implement the randomizer settings. [0%]
11. How to combine different settings, if they are used. [0%]

After that, creating randomizer settings would be relatively trivial (Or perhaps I haven't thought about that much, so it looks trivial but isn't)

Here's a few "normal" rando settings I thought of:

- Weapons/armor replaced by similar ones of same class (could break balance and make the game easier).
- Weapons/armor replaced by any other weapon/armor.
- Randomly place weapons/armor over the levels.
- Randomize enemies (worms -> iron golems would be fun).
- Randomly place enemies over the levels.
- Randomize everyone's disposition.
- Randomize item's intrinsic cost. Maybe appraise would become a useful skill?
- Randomize fountain effects (No more retreating to the healing fountains in lvl2!)
- No starting bag. You'll have to find the automap by yourself (oof)

Anyway, I was daydreaming a few cool rando settings.

- Ranger's dream: melee weapons replaced by ranged weapons/bows.
- Penance: no weapons or money available.
- Starvation mode: Food reduced by 1/n (variable n), hidden Ylem rune for create food (In Mani Ylem?), no fishing rods.
- Russian roulette: All weapons and armor receive random bonuses/curses. (Does an npc's weapon affect its attack? Facing a bandit with firedoom axe/black sword is definitely frightening!)
- Merchant's mercy: Weapon and food are only available as barter goods. You'll have to scramble for money to get any progress done. Devious if combined with an item cost modifier.
- Invisible horrors: All monsters become dire ghosts.
- Lockdown: all doors are locked. Lockpicking or bashing only.
- Let's play a game: Place traps at random spots.
- Dislexia: Inspired by that setting in the Quest 64 rando. Randomly changes one vowel in a name into another.
- Peaceful mode: no hostiles.

# Randomizer

## Introduction

This project aims to randomize the object positions in Ultima Underworld, to provide a fresh experience for experienced players.

## Current status

**HALTED**

Real life caught up to me, so development is halted. I'll update this only very sporadically.

* Working on loading the lev.ark file from actual save games, and check if they've loaded correctly.
* Working on modifying the lev.ark file, i.e., adding or removing items. Thinking about how to properly do this, i.e., with a separate Editor class or directly with Loader class itself.
* Working on implementing logic.

## Acknowledgements

# Randomizer

This project aims to randomize the object positions in Ultima Underworld, to provide a fresh experience for experienced players.

First, I'm working on loading and editing functionalities. I want to provide a relatively straightforward Object Oriented approach to the game's levels,
so others can edit stuff without having to mess with operations in binary directly.

Then, I'll work on some randomizer logic.

I've transferred my current questions and development to the Issues tab.

Here's a few "normal" rando settings I thought of:

- Weapons/armor replaced by similar ones of same class (could break balance and make the game easier).
- Weapons/armor replaced by any other weapon/armor.
- Randomly place weapons/armor over the levels.
- Randomize enemies (worms -> iron golems would be fun).
- Randomly place enemies over the levels.
- Randomize everyone's disposition.
- Randomize item's intrinsic cost. Maybe appraise would become a useful skill?
- Randomize fountain effects (No more retreating to the healing fountains in lvl2!)
- No starting bag. You'll have to find the automap by yourself (oof)

Anyway, I was daydreaming a few cool rando settings.

- Ranger's dream: melee weapons replaced by ranged weapons/bows.
- Penance: no weapons or money available.
- Starvation mode: Food reduced by 1/n (variable n), hidden Ylem rune for create food (In Mani Ylem?), no fishing rods.
- Russian roulette: All weapons and armor receive random bonuses/curses. (Does an npc's weapon affect its attack? Facing a bandit with firedoom axe/black sword is definitely frightening!)
- Merchant's mercy: Weapon and food are only available as barter goods. You'll have to scramble for money to get any progress done. Devious if combined with an item cost modifier.
- Invisible horrors: All monsters become dire ghosts.
- Lockdown: all doors are locked. Lockpicking or bashing only.
- Let's play a game: Place traps at random spots.
- Dislexia: Inspired by that setting in the Quest 64 rando. Randomly changes one vowel in a name into another.
- Peaceful mode: no hostiles.
